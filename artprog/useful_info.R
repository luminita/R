## 1. Getting started
# data sets in R 
data()
# modulo operator is %% 
3%%2
# a global variable can be written to from within a function using <<-
x<-2
f<-function() x<<-3
f()
x
# you can use mode(x) to see the mode of a variable 
x<-c("abc", "d")
mode(x)
# matrix multiplication operator is %*%
# compact way of printing lists is using str()
hn<-hist(Nile)
str(hn)
# instances of classes in R are usually just list with extra class attributes 
# you can use the options() function to see the different options 
# that you can configure in an .Rprofile file 
# .Rdata stores the data, and .Rhistory stores the command history
# use the example functionto run th eexamples that come in the help
example(persp)
# get help about a package 
help(package=MASS)
# good tips for searching in the end of the book 


## 2. Vectors 
# when using something like 1:length(x), make sure length(x) > 0; better use seq
# matrices are stored BY COLUMN 
# negative subscripts exclude elements 
x<-c(1, 7, 9)
x[-1]
# use seq instead of length
x<-c(12, 13, 14, 15)
for (i in seq(x)) print(i)
# NA:unknown and NULL:nonexistent
# filtering: make elements > 3 equal to 0 
x <- 1:10
x[x > 3] <- 0
x
# filtering can be done with subset in which case NA are treated differently 
# find indexes at which a condition is true 
x <- 1:10
which(x > 3)


## 3. Matrices and arrays 
# matrices are vectors with two attributes: number of rows and number of columns 
# matrices are stored in column-major order
# example: generate a covariance matrix of size n with correlation rho between variables
makecov <- function(n, rho) {
  res <- matrix(nrow=n, ncol=n)
  res <- ifelse(row(res) == col(res), 1, rho)
  return(res)
}
makecov(3, 0.7)
# matrix has an attribute called dim
x <- matrix(1:8,nrow=4)
class(x)
attributes(x)
# to avoid reducing the dimension of the matrix, you can use the drop argument at slicing 

## 4. Lists 
# lists are equivalent of python dictionaries 
# how to access elements in a list 
x<-list(name="John", salary=30000, union=T)
x$name
x[["name"]]
x[[1]]
# ! If single brackets are used, then the result is another list! -> you can do slicing 
x[1]
# to delete an element just make it NULL
x$union<-NULL
x
# lapply applies a function to each of the components of a list and returns a list 
# sapply simplifies the result to a vector or a matrix 
x<-list(1:10, 1:20)
lapply(x, median)
sapply(x, median)
# you can index using a vector 
x<-list(name="John", salary=30000, union=T)
x[c("name", "salary")]
# order returns the indices of a sorted vector wrt the original vector 
y<-c(7, 1, 9)
order(y)
# interesting example of using lapply: at which positions in a vector different letters appear
g<-c("F", "M", "M", "F", "F")
indices<-lapply(list(F="F", M="M"), function(gender) which(g==gender))
indices
