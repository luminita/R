A/B testing 
-----------
- Generalities
  * an A/B test need to have a defined outcome that is measurable such as number of sales 
  made, click-rate conversion etc 
  * one treatment may be more successfull within a certain customer segment even if it 
  performs worse otherwise 
- Comparing means 
  * use Student t-test or Welch's t test (less assumptions)
- Comparing two binomial distributions 
  * use Fisher's exact test
